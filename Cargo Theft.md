Theft can occur from, but not limited to, the following:

- ■ Methods of transportation: pipeline system, railroad car, motor truck, tank, vessel, aircraft, other vehicle
- ■ Locations: storage facility, station house, platform, depot, wharf, airport, air navigation facility, container freight station, warehouse, freight distribution facility, freight consolidation facility
- ■ Containers: intermodal container, intermodal chassis, trailer

## Types of cargo theft

Straight cargo theft occurs when cargo is physically stolen from its current location. Cargo thieves often look for items they can steal and sell quickly.

This often occurs at truck stops, parking lots, roadside parking, drop lots, rail yards and other situations where cargo is left unattended.

Strategic cargo theft occurs when thieves incorporate deceptive tactics to commit theft. This type of cargo theft involves the use of fraud to trick shippers, brokers, and carriers into handing loads over to thieves instead of the legitimate carrier. Other current strategic cargo theft trends include identity theft, fictitious pick-ups, account takeovers, double brokering scams, and fraudulent carriers as well as the implementation of a combination of these methods.

Cyber cargo theft occurs when basic types of cyberattacks are used to aid in committing cargo theft. The attacks include phishing emails that install Trojan Horse malware granting access to a company's systems for thieves to retrieve sensitive data. Thieves then use this information to print out copies of legitimate shipping paperwork they can use to commit fictitious pick-ups.

Pilferage cargo theft occurs when criminals alter the bill of lading and pilfer small amounts off the truck.

## How to protect yourself

- ■  Never leave loads unattended, especially in known cargo theft areas.
- ■  Use high security rear door locks and air cuff locks.
- ■  If it's unavoidable to stage/drop a load, consider installing landing gear locks as well.
- ■  Research contact information and company information thoroughly through the FMCSA, internet search engines, and third-party vetting services.
- ■  Work closely with shippers to confirm positive identities of drivers at the point of pick up-including driver information, truck, and trailer identifier information-and use a secure pick-up number for security measures.
- ■  When using online load boards, exercise increased caution and due diligence to verify the identities of people and companies you are contracting with.
